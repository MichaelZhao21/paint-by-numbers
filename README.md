# Paint by Numbers!

Work in progress...

As the name suggests, this is a Paint by Numbers generator and player. Inspired by my [QWERHacks 2025 project](https://devpost.com/software/paint-by-campus), I wanted to remake the paint by numbers app to be faster and fully client-side. To do this, I re-wrote the backend part in Rust with the intention of compiling it to WebAssembly.

## Rust compilation

To run, all you need to do is run:

```bash
cargo run
```

Configuration todo

## Running the app
